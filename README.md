1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/V4rnit/AlgoPath.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd AlgoPath
```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser:
```
open index.html
```

Or simply double-click the `index.html` file to open it in your default browser.

## Usage

1. Browse the main page to see all available topics
2. Click on any topic card to view the list of problems
3. Click on a problem name to open it on LeetCode
4. Click on the YouTube icon to watch the NeetCode solution video
5. Use the difficulty indicators to filter problems by complexity

## Project Structure

```
AlgoPath/
├── index.html          # Main HTML file
├── style.css           # Stylesheet with dark theme and animations
├── main.js             # JavaScript file (currently empty)
